    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Various factors may contribute to estimating a person’s age. Factors which may be associated with age include employment status, education level, and/or marital status. According to Statistics Canada, 15 to 24 were the most likely to work part-time, followed by workers aged 55 and older. People in the core working ages of 25 to 54 were the least likely to be part-time. Additionally, women were twice as likely as men to work part-time. These part-time rates have been relatively stable over the last 20 years (Patterson, 2018). A 2013 study published by the US Bureau of Labor Statistics found that marriage patterns differed markedly by age at marriage and by educational attainment (Aughinbaugh et al., 2013).\n",
    "\n",
    "The data we will be using was collected by Ronny Kohavi and Barry Becker, and extracted from the 1994 Census bureau database. This data contains several variables: age (17 and up), education level (preschool and above), marital status, relationship status, race, gender, occupation, weekly working hours, etc. We will be focusing on the prediction of average age in our project. \n",
    "\n",
    "Using this dataset, we will answer the following question:\n",

Then, we will compute the RMSE of the model. \n",

Since our goal here is to estimate the average age, we would need a prediction model. Hence, we determine our best optimal model by looking at the Cp value.\n",
    "\n",
    "After we select our best model, we will use the `predict()` function again to predict the testing set and calculate the RMSE. We will then compare the RMSE of both the full model and the newly predicted optimal model, as well as perform the F-test to determine which is better. After we finish determining the best model, we will use it to predict the average age and the 95% confidence interval for prediction (CIP). Since our prediction is used to predict the average age using statistically significant variables, we would have one variation which is the difference between our prediction and the average age of the population.  Finally, we can use our predictive model to predict out-of-sample data.\n",
